Zeppelin to jupyter notebook
============================

The Zeppelin users may have same problem with me that the Zeppelin ``.json`` notebook is hard to open and read. **ze2nb**: A piece of code to convert Zeppelin ``.json`` notebook to ``.ipynb`` Jupyter notebook, ``.py`` and ``.html`` file. This library is based on Ryan Blue's Jupyter/Zeppelin conversion: [jupyter-zeppelin]_. The API book can be found at `ze2nb API`_ or [zeppelin2nb]_.  **You may download and distribute it. Please be aware, however, that the note contains typos as well as inaccurate or incorrect description.**
