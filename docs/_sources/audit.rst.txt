Auditing on Big Dataset 
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In this section, we will demonstrate the auditing performance and audited results on the big data set.
The data set is ``Spanish High Speed Rail tickets pricing``.  It is available at :
https://www.kaggle.com/thegurus/spanish-high-speed-rail-system-ticket-pricing. This data set has 2579771 
samples and 10 features. 

From the following CPU time, you will see most
of the time was spent on plotting the histograms. If your time and memory are limited, we will suggest
you to use ``sample_size`` to generate the subset of the the dataset to plot histograms.
